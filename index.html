Almost handsome white male speaker. Dramatic pauses, grins intermixed with serious faces, small gestures, throughout)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m starting a cult leader training camp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">(Audience laughs)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I know I know. Kinda crazy. But maybe I should start at the beginning? Let you in on a secret.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>This world is made up of individuals such as you and me. We go about our lives, day in and day out, thinking about things, making decisions, doing stuff. Acting. Actions. </span><span class="c0">These actions change the world - sometimes in a tiny way, just moving the TV remote from the side table to the coffee table. Sometimes big things like war or love or creating a new life. We call these individuals Agents and their ability to impact their own fate Agency.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Over the years many have asked .... A</span><span>m I </span><span class="c13">really</span><span>&nbsp;in control?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Or am I a domino among many, standing until it is my turn to fall?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m afraid it isn&#39;t so cut and dry. No such luck. You see this isn&#39;t an all or nothing game, where you have Agency or you don&rsquo;t. Let&#39;s break this down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">(Holds up two fingers)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>T</span><span>wo ingredients come into pla</span><span class="c0">y, the ability to predict outcomes and the ability to influence outcomes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">(Holds up one finger)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>First is predicting outcomes. Do you have any idea what the consequences of your actions are? You&rsquo;re on a gameshow and asked to pick a door, any door .... </span><span>but you don&#39;t know what is behind door number three</span><span>, or any of the doors for that matter! That&#39;s not a real choice. That&#39;s </span><span>not </span><span>Agency</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even when you have an idea about consequences it is usually still rough. Maybe you know what the immediate result of your actions will be, and even what will happen right after that... But how far out can you see what&#39;s coming? Tomorrow? Next week? Next year?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>It depends. Let&rsquo;s say you&#39;re an expert house builder, years of experience. You know that by adding that extra beam the roof will stay up, and without it the roof will, in the next big storm, fall. You can predict the outcome with a high degree of confidence. Alas, you are a builder and not an engine </span><span>mechanic</span><span class="c0">. So if I ask you what happens if this car engine runs hot for a bit you have no idea what the consequence is. How hot is too hot? Will it explode in a few minutes or break next week? In some areas you have a better idea of consequences than in others. Your ability to predict the future varies based on the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Let me say that again. Your ability to predict the future </span><span>varies</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;based on the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hold that thought a moment while we talk about ingredient number two.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">(Holds up two fingers again)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The second ingredient is </span><span>influential power</span><span>. Pure mechanical power at the most basic - the strength necessary to pick up and </span><span>move that TV remote</span><span>&nbsp;and push some buttons. But soft power or indirect power counts </span><span>too</span><span>. Before you can pick a gameshow door </span><span>you first have</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to be on that stage, positioned and empowered to act.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Influencing the world around you is also a bit </span><span>situational</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;though, isn&#39;t it? You might have a key that gives you the power to unlock the front door of your house. Try to enter another house and the key won&#39;t work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Assign your </span><span>employee</span><span>&nbsp;a task and they </span><span>hop to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it. Assign it to a stranger on the bus and it might not get done at all!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">(small audience laugh)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Your ability to influence the world varies based on the situation. It varies based on your skills, your positioning, the tools available to you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Here we are again. Your ability to influence outcomes </span><span>varies</span><span>&nbsp;based on the situation, just like your ability to predict the future </span><span>varies</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;based on the situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>OK, now let&rsquo;s look at them together. You want both of these things. Take your ability to influence your world and combine it with your ability to anticipate the future. With the combination of these two ingredients, </span><span>you at last achieve Agency</span><span class="c0">. Freedom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Influence without knowing what the consequences of your actions are is just gambling. That&#39;s </span><span>not a real</span><span>&nbsp;Free </span><span>Choice</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Knowing what is going to happen next, but not being in a position to influence that outcome? Well that&#39;s not really a Free Choice either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>You need both. You perform an action and understand the consequences. You desire an outcome and are positioned to affect the necessary change. You </span><span>have Agency</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Now we come to the heart of the matter.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Your Agency is built up of these two parts, your ability to predict outcomes and your ability to influence the world. But your ability to predict outcomes varies! Your ability to influence the world varies!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>You see. That all or nothing world? Free or not free? </span><span>Domino or Agent</span><span class="c0">? It is not only somewhere in-between. Oh no it is worse, and better, than that. You see... Your agency, your ability to control the world with knowledge of the result - that too varies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yes, that&#39;s right. That&#39;s the first part of the secret. Your agency is not all or nothing but somewhere in the middle and always based on the situation and context.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Your Agency varies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But there is a second part to the secret. Are you ready?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You can change how much Agency you have. You can increase your amount of freedom. You can gain deeper degrees of Free Will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Based on our two ingredients of predicting and influencing this becomes</span><span>&nbsp;obvious</span><span class="c0">. Want to get better at understanding outcomes, at modeling and predicting results? Go to school. Become a subject matter expert. Increase your ability to predict outcomes and you are increasing the meaningfulness of your actions, you are increasing your Agency.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">How about the other side. How do you get more influence? More power? Hm. Ok maybe that one is not as easy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Or is it? That brings us back to my cult school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">(Audience chuckles)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>There has been a </span><span>lot of media</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;about scams and cults lately. Pyramid schemes, Ponzi schemes, organic farming coops. Not only media about the organizations, but also their members and especially their leaders. We are all enthralled, &nbsp;enchanted, &nbsp;entranced. How do the leaders work? How can they get people to do things, to believe things? Why are followers drawn to the leader like a moth to a flame?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Most importantly, </span><span class="c13">how can I become the cult leader or be at the top of the pyramid</span><span class="c0">?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">(Audience laughs)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I can tell you how they do it. They do it through building and expanding their Agency until it extends beyond themselves and into their followers. They leverage their own predictive power and use it to organize a hoard of predictors. They leverage their small influence to make an army of influencers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You can do this too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>I&rsquo;ve done research, I&rsquo;ve run experiments, and I&rsquo;ve built a framework to follow, and I invite you to build off of it all. It might take you a few tries, </span><span>it did for me</span><span>, but once you get a bit of a foundation under your belt </span><span>you, too, can </span><span class="c0">write books. Write checks. Right wrongs. Give TED talks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Welcome to Cult Camp. You&rsquo;re already a part of it by being here, in this talk, in this moment. But you can take it further. The full Cult Camp experience is a top of the line retreat deep in the Vermont forest where we learn from each other and build a new way to look at the world. It is a place for leaders to step into the deep waters of managing people, managing teams, managing hearts and minds. A place where you learn to not only increase your Agency, but to amplify it!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>I know you&#39;re skeptical.</span><span>&nbsp;You might think</span><span>&nbsp;this is yet another con or yet another generic leadership training workshop - but actually I am bringing you to the inside of the con that you&#39;re already a part of. All around you are people </span><span>wh</span><span>ose Agency </span><span>is like a domino</span><span>, standing in line ready to fall. There </span><span>are, however, those</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>special few Agents who</span><span>&nbsp;step outside the domino </span><span>chain</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;so they can see down the line and decide on their own when to knock down the next piece instead of waiting to be pushed over themselves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>You have to ask yourself what do you want to be?
